## <span style="font-weight: normal;">1\. IFTTT Recipe ðŸ“±</span>

1.  [Click Flic button](https://ifttt.com/applets/44303349d-if-you-click-flic-then-share-location-in-sms){:target="_blank"} - sends text with location
2.  [Hold Flic button](https://ifttt.com/applets/44350944d-if-you-hold-flic-then-send-an-alert-sms-with-location){:target="_blank"} - sends alert text with location

### <span style="font-weight: normal;">Description</span>

A project Iâ€™ve been thinking about addresses a problem that Iâ€™ve faced with an aging parent who is home alone often and a wife who exercises at night by herself. Typical alert bracelets are antiquated, target geriatrics, and require a monthly monitoring fee.

Solution: A wearable device that senses falls, and allows user to press a button to send a pre-defined text to family / friends via bluetooth and smartphone.

To make a quick MVP of the core press-button feature, I am using [Flic](http://flic.io){:target="_blank"}, an IOT button that pairs via bluetooth to an Android or iOS device and interacts with many internet services. I was going to CAD model a watch strap backing for Flic so it could be worn as a watch, but discovered [Shapeways](http://shpws.me/LeuU){:target="_blank"} already had one! I bought a cheap watch strap from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B017CK4PAQ/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1){:target="_blank"}, and now I have an MVP!

Since Iâ€™m assuming you donâ€™t have a Flic lying around the office, hereâ€™s a video of it in action.

## <span style="font-weight: normal;">2\. Pinterest Keyboard Project ðŸ“Œ</span>

This is a project I worked on earlier this year. I shipped to the [App Store](http://pinkyapp.com){:target="_blank"} in June. I led all aspects of writing requirements and wireframing. I worked with a designer to polish and a developer to build.

I used [Quip](https://quip.com/wBAaA8msyPoN){:target="_blank"} to write initial requirements to share and get feedback. I used [Invision App](https://invis.io/M957BYD8V){:target="_blank"}Â for sharing screens and experience. I used [Sketch](https://sketch.cloud/s/RWOy/p/onboarding){:target="_blank"} to iterate on high fidelity designs. I used [Zeplin](https://scene.zeplin.io/project/56d88a9e32057a3d4cde4666){:target="_blank"} to share layered Sketch files with developer.

### Outcome

The project cost about $2,000 in total. It has $0 recurring cost. I've been able to generate some organic downloads, but I knew going in that generating downloads in the App Store would be very expensive and time-consuming. It was a great learning experience getting an app in the App Store and it continues to be a utility that I and a few friends can use ðŸ˜€

## Optional A

Last week I spoke with our [Connectifier](https://www.connectifier.com) account manager as well as our team about continuing with their service. Our yearly contract was coming up for renewal and they were recently acquired by LinkedIn. I was made aware that their pricing structure was changing, and after this year the service would require a LinkedIn Recruiter plan.

I decided with our COO not to renew based on a few factors I uncovered:

*   Increase in pricing

*   Understanding our current usage - anecdotally from team, and actual usage metrics from account rep

*   Understanding how heavily team relied on service, could they stop-gap with other service(s)?

*   Instability of company. Recently acquired and were straightforward about requiring an expensive LinkedIn Recruiter subscription next year. Buying into a service even deeper with the knowledge of it changing within a year didn't make sense

## Optional B
