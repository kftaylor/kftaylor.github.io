## **1\. IFTTT Recipe**

1.  [Click Flic button](https://ifttt.com/applets/44303349d-if-you-click-flic-then-share-location-in-sms){:target="_blank"} - sends text with location
2.  [Hold Flic button](https://ifttt.com/applets/44350944d-if-you-hold-flic-then-send-an-alert-sms-with-location){:target="_blank"} - sends alert text with location

### **Description**

A project I’ve been thinking about addresses a problem that I’ve faced with an aging parent who is home alone often and a wife who exercises at night by herself. Typical alert bracelets are antiquated, target geriatrics, and require a monthly monitoring fee.

Solution: A wearable device that senses falls, and allows user to press a button to send a pre-defined text to family / friends.

To make a quick MVP of the core button feature, I am using [Flic](http://flic.io){:target="_blank"}, a button that pairs via Bluetooth to an android or ios device and connects with many internet services. I was going to CAD model a watch strap backing for Flic so it could be worn as a watch, but discovered [Shapeways](http://shpws.me/LeuU){:target="_blank"} already had one! I bought a cheap watch strap from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B017CK4PAQ/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1){:target="_blank"}, and now I have an MVP!

Since I’m assuming you don’t have a Flic lying around the office, here’s a video of it in action.

## **2\. Pinterest Keyboard Project**

This is a project I worked on earlier this year. Shipped to the [App Store](http://pinkyapp.com) in June. I led all aspects of writing requirements and wireframing, then I worked with a designer and developer to polish and build. 

I used [Quip](https://quip.com/wBAaA8msyPoN) to write initial requirements to share and get feedback. I used [Invision App](https://invis.io/M957BYD8V) for sharing clickthrough screens and UX. I used [Sketch](https://sketch.cloud/s/RWOy/p/onboarding) to iterate on high fidelity designs. I used [Zeplin](https://scene.zeplin.io/project/56d88a9e32057a3d4cde4666) to share layered Sketch files with developer. 

### Outcome:

The project cost about $2,000 total. It has $0 recurring costs. I've been able to generate some organic downloads, but I knew going in that generating downloads in the App Store is very expensive. It was a great learning experience and a utility that I and a few friends can use!
