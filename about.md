**1. IFTTT Recipe**

1.  [Click Flic button](https://ifttt.com/applets/44303349d-if-you-click-flic-then-share-location-in-sms), sends text with location
2.  <span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">[Hold Flic button](https://ifttt.com/applets/44350944d-if-you-hold-flic-then-send-an-alert-sms-with-location), sends alert text with location</span>  

**Description** –

A project I’ve been thinking about addresses a problem that I’ve faced with an aging parent who is home alone often, and a wife who exercises at night by herself. Typical alert bracelets are antiquated, target geriatrics, and require a monthly monitoring fee. 

Solution: A wearable device that senses falls, and allows user to press a button to send a pre-defined text to family / friends.

To make a quick MVP of the core button feature, I am using [Flic](flic.io), a button that pairs via Bluetooth to an android or ios device and connects with many internet services. I was going to CAD model a watch strap backing for Flic so it could be worn as a watch, but discovered [Shapeways](http://shpws.me/LeuU) already had one! I bought a cheap watch strap from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B017CK4PAQ/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1), and now I have an MVP!

Since I’m assuming you don’t have a Flic lying around the office, here’s a video of it in action.
